# Expectations-in-SIA

What I expect in this subject is to learn the basics of system design and integration concepts and understand the connection of different technologies, systems, components and so on and how they work together as whole. I would also love to know how they interact with each other to make a complex system work to provide a seamless experience for users.

I also expect this subject to introduce me to real-world applications of system architecture and integration. Learning about architectural patterns and integration tools will help me see how these ideas are applied in industries like e-commerce, healthcare, and education. By doing so, I can connect what I learn in class to situations that I may face in the future.

Lastly, I expect that this subject will not only improve my technical knowledge but also strengthen my critical thinking and teamwork skills. I know that working with systems requires planning for security, scalability, and reliability, which are important for my growth as a student and future IT professional. I believe that what I learn here will serve as a good foundation for my care
